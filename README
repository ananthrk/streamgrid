Dependecies:
	FFMPEG (for slicer)
	flvtools (for slicer)
	PIL
	PyOpenGL

flvtools isn't currently a public project, but you can add video streams to 
streamgrid by creating a folder called "frames" and adding sequentially 
numbered jpg files to the directory.  Check the source of streamgrid.py for
more details.
